In this project we are creating hash tables in C to better understand Python dictionaries.
---
0. Create a new, empty hash table.
1. Implement the djb2 algorithm in a custom function.
2. Write a function using djb2 that returns the index of a key.
3. Write a function that adds elements to a hash table.
4. Retrieve a value associated with a given key.
5. Print the entire given hash table.
6. Delete the entire given hash table.
